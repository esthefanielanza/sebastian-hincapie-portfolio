Besides that, I have been helping <strong>Verizon</strong> with their new product <strong><a href='https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/family-money/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Family Money</a></strong>, a task that has been utterly satisfying and challenging at the same time. </p><p>Having led and being part of design teams for years in this young, rapidly growing technology environment - taught me how to balance business goals and engineering constraints as I unrelentingly advocated for the user.<./p><p>I graduated from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Colombia with a degree in Visual Arts. This has taught me all the design spectrum, from analog and digital illustration, to typography, photography, sculpture, cinema and user experience, my specialized field for 7 years now.</p><p>I grew up in Colombia but have lived in different countries throughout my life - England, Argentina, Mexico. Having experienced different cultures has strengthen my ability to adjust to new challenges and embrace different cultures understanding all points of view and that is something you can see in my designs and also in my <strong><a href='https://www.behance.net/sebastianhincapie' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>concept art.</a></strong></p>",
