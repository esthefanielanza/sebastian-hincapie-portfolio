This has taught me all the design spectrum, from analog and digital illustration, to typography, photography, sculpture, cinema and user experience, my specialized field for 7 years now.</p><p>I grew up in Colombia but have lived in different countries throughout my life - England, Argentina, Mexico. Having experienced different cultures has strengthen my ability to adjust to new challenges and embrace different cultures understanding all points of view and that is something you can see in my designs and also in my <strong><a href='https://www.behance.net/sebastianhincapie' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>concept art.</a></strong></p>",

It’s also ranked further down (No. 30) in the Shopping section on the App Store.</p><p>What this meant was a disparity of interest in the different Walmart services that were condensed into two applications. <strong>This made no sense as it does not represent the way people shop, which is not a binary experience.</strong></p><p>Of course this meant that at the business level, grocery revenue was not being the same as Walmart.com, and the experience was feeling outdated in many of its parts, and this had to be solved quickly.</p>"
